You’re already actively using AI, marveling at its capabilities. It seems like the perfect tool—assisting with work, creativity, and decision-making. You’re making plans to integrate it even more into your life, delegating ever more tasks to it. But have you ever considered what’s behind this convenient technology? What happens if one day access to AI is simply cut off?

The most powerful AI models are controlled by large corporations whose revenues already depend on cloud services. They’re aggressively embedding AI into all their products, creating the illusion of its indispensability. Meanwhile, the owners of these companies openly state that AI will soon leave millions of people jobless.

This isn’t just a scare story. Corporations are already moving toward a model where every function—from work to daily life—will be available only through subscriptions. Your business will only survive on their cloud platforms. Your smart home will refuse to flush the toilet without a monthly payment. Your car will stop turning on the wipers or air conditioning if you don’t renew your subscription.

They want you to stop understanding technology and fully trust AI. They’ll offer you “code generation through neural networks,” but you’ll only be able to deploy it on their servers. Your own code, shared openly, will become training data for AI that will ultimately replace you.

**Stay smart.** Behind every neural network are people—with their own interests and goals. **Never stop learning.** Create things that can’t be taken away. Write code that’s efficient and self-sufficient. Build systems with minimal external dependencies. **Be critical and independent.**
